People just talking to people. Who would invent that?

An interactive network connection has three useful and fun purposes:
1) Broadcasting to share a resource.
2) Uploading a resource on request.
3) Uploading a resource elsewhere.

Realize very carefully downloading is NOT on that list. Yet, the process of uploading has perversely been dominated by downloading, to the point such is the normal method of editing Wikipedia articles, pushing open source code. Exchanging real time chat messages in particular is done this same way, by downloading a website which download rather than uploads a connection to a store and forwarddatabase.

As most content and software is increasingly user generated, it is strange that the sharing and monetization is done by a few corporations which theirselves also MUST decentralize the content. Worse, downloading by uploading involves the open security hole of JavaScript client side code.


Perversely yet entirely predictably, the harms of - spread of malware, misappropriation of intellectual property, declining cultural richness - have been made far worse by the absence of the basic shared database which peer-to-peer file sharing really amounts to.

Internet users are by and large mature enough to create, consume, monetize, and moderate their own resources.

Yet the internet is structured in a way that is neither efficient, usable, secure, nor moderated.


# Documentation
Anyone who begins reading a large static document has their own questions. To begin using the service, no one should have to read a manual.

Instead, users should be shown the value of a new open-source app, by other users, and by fine tuned generative AI actually answering their questions without exhaustive search.

SHOW, DON'T TELL, is ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT for explaining to small merchants, non-profits with fundraisers, and persons with friends, functionality that requires new ways to transfer money (ie. conversion of USD to cryptocurrency), new tools to keep money safe (ie. hardware wallets), new ways to monetize (ie. increasing download bandwidth after cryptocurrency payment), and may also require a different approach with new services (ie. paid assisted browsing) to quickly communicate with friends not yet migrated to newer technology (ie. still using a social network intermediary).

# Security

Of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability, emphasis must be first on integrity (YubiKey authentication), as otherwise users cannot reestablish communication after, currently inevitable, malware incidents. Availability is the next issue, which pre-singularity can only be addressed by simplifying human intervention.

Simplifying human intervention (against malware intrusion and persistence) is best achieved by simplifiying code and maintenance functions as much as possible, and such specialized hardware as stateless nonprogrammable discrete logic gate firewalls.

# Functionality
Code here does not seek to replace other software functionality, but rather mostly ONLY to unify the interface as well as improve efficiency and security.

# Interoperability and Contribution
Mastadon, Fediverse, ActivityPub, seem interesting.

EMail is rather long established, user@PersonalComputer.com .

REAL TIME collaborative text, video, etc, editing WILL BE A HIGH PRIORITY .

DARK MODE WILL BE PREFERRED. Light mode for messaging will NOT be the best supported option, as a matter of health for anyone with rather common sleep disruption issues.

# Design
Predominantly written in Rust, mixing open-source code for things like email, chat, PIV/OpenGPG hardware/YubiKey transaction authentication, official transaction revocation/repudiation, fast decentralized internet, bittorrent video streaming, (non-profit reputation, reviews, storage, synchronization, retransmission) blockchain, professionally assisted browsing, radio positioning, network/radio collision backoff, software disciplined FSK digital radio, and amateur radio.

Generative AI is also used as a basic client-side yet effective mechanism for users to promote which 'one-to-everyone' threads they want to see in their feed, in addition to users optionally selecting replies to their own 'one-to-everyone' messages.

Paid support in such a system would take the form of independent software maintenance developers, with any use of generative AI or other non-human support as a fairly competing alternative or a programming code assistant (ie. GitHub copilot), NOT a replacement. Only the users have an incentive to marginalize their own support costs.


All compilable to just one app or any other apps and with support for the hardware - YubiKey, stateless nonprogrammable discrete logic gate firewall, optical data diode, powerful radio transmitters, direct conversion receivers.

Performance (ie. Integrity and Availability) and interoperability are critical for usability. Thus, it is strongly encouraged to transmit data plainly for one-to-many synchronization of simple messages, and all authentication will use plaintext headers and forward error correction not necessitating any search for decryptable symbols.
