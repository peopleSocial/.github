People just talking to people. Who would invent that?

Instead of a social network, just the code for a common language to speak into the publicly shared internet and radio space around the globe.

Predominantly written in Rust, mixing open-source code for things like email, chat, PIV/OpenGPG hardware/YubiKey transaction authentication, official transaction revocation/repudiation, fast decentralized internet, bittorrent video streaming, (non-profit storage, synchronization, retransmission) blockchain, professionally assisted browsing, radio positioning, network/radio collision backoff, software disciplined FSK digital radio, and amateur radio. 


All compilable to just one app or any other apps and with support for the hardware - YubiKey, stateless nonprogrammable discrete logic gate firewall, optical data diode, powerful radio transmitters, direct conversion receivers.


AGPLv3 for all code not owned by other authors. Independent development will be done if necessary to minimize non-AGPLv3 code. NO relicensing, never, not ever.
