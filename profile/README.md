People just talking to people. Who would invent that?

Instead of a social network, just the code for a common language (ie. bittorrent protocol) to speak into the publicly shared internet and radio space around the globe.

The major advantage of such direct one-to-many communication, is the absence of targeted advertising.

The major advantage of an absence of targeted advertising, is the drastically reduced attack surface for both cybersecurity integrity exploits, and for bad management following up.

ie. You don't have a poorly managed account to get locked out of with zero customer service, you have an ISP and a government issued amateur radio license - you're more or less innocent until proven guilty in court.

# Design
Predominantly written in Rust, mixing open-source code for things like email, chat, PIV/OpenGPG hardware/YubiKey transaction authentication, official transaction revocation/repudiation, fast decentralized internet, bittorrent video streaming, (non-profit reputation, reviews, storage, synchronization, retransmission) blockchain, professionally assisted browsing, radio positioning, network/radio collision backoff, software disciplined FSK digital radio, and amateur radio.

Generative AI is also used as a basic client-side yet effective mechanism for users to promote which 'one-to-everyone' threads they want to see in their feed, in addition to users optionally selecting replies to their own 'one-to-everyone' messages.

Paid support in such a system would take the form of independent software maintenance developers, with any use of generative AI or other non-human support as a fairly competing alternative or a programming code assistant (ie. GitHub copilot), NOT a replacement. Only the users have an incentive to marginalize their own support costs.


All compilable to just one app or any other apps and with support for the hardware - YubiKey, stateless nonprogrammable discrete logic gate firewall, optical data diode, powerful radio transmitters, direct conversion receivers.

Performance (ie. Integrity and Availability) and interoperability are critical for usability. Thus, data will be transmitted plainly for one-to-many synchronization, and all authentication will use plaintext headers and forward error correction not necessitating any search for decryptable symbols.
