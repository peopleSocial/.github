People just talking to people. Who would invent that?

Instead of a social network, just the code for a common language (ie. bittorrent protocol) to speak into the publicly shared internet and radio space around the globe.

The major advantage of such direct one-to-many communication, is the absence of targeted advertising.

The major advantage of an absence of targeted advertising, is the drastically reduced attack surface for both cybersecurity integrity exploits, and for bad management following up.

ie. You don't have a poorly managed account to get locked out of with zero customer service, you have an ISP and a government issued amateur radio license - you're more or less innocent until proven guilty in court.

# Documentation
Anyone who begins reading a large static document has their own questions. To begin using the service, no one should have to read a manual.

Instead, users should be shown the value of a new open-source app, by other users, and by fine tuned generative AI actually answering their questions without exhaustive search.

SHOW, DON'T TELL, is ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT for explaining to small merchants, non-profits with fundraisers, and persons with friends, functionality that requires new ways to transfer money (ie. conversion of USD to cryptocurrency), new tools to keep money safe (ie. hardware wallets), new ways to monetize (ie. increasing download bandwidth after cryptocurrency payment), and may also require a different approach with new services (ie. paid assisted browsing) to quickly communicate with friends not yet migrated to newer technology (ie. still using a social network intermediary).

# Security

Of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability, emphasis must be first on integrity (YubiKey authentication), as otherwise users cannot reestablish communication after, currently inevitable, malware incidents. Availability is the next issue, which pre-singularity can only be addressed by simplifying human intervention and stateless nonprogrammable discrete logic gate firewalls.

# Functionality
Code here does not seek to replace other software functionality, but rather mostly ONLY to unify the interface as well as improve efficiency and security.

# Interoperability and Contribution
Mastadon, Fediverse, ActivityPub, seem interesting.

# Design
Predominantly written in Rust, mixing open-source code for things like email, chat, PIV/OpenGPG hardware/YubiKey transaction authentication, official transaction revocation/repudiation, fast decentralized internet, bittorrent video streaming, (non-profit reputation, reviews, storage, synchronization, retransmission) blockchain, professionally assisted browsing, radio positioning, network/radio collision backoff, software disciplined FSK digital radio, and amateur radio.

Generative AI is also used as a basic client-side yet effective mechanism for users to promote which 'one-to-everyone' threads they want to see in their feed, in addition to users optionally selecting replies to their own 'one-to-everyone' messages.

Paid support in such a system would take the form of independent software maintenance developers, with any use of generative AI or other non-human support as a fairly competing alternative or a programming code assistant (ie. GitHub copilot), NOT a replacement. Only the users have an incentive to marginalize their own support costs.


All compilable to just one app or any other apps and with support for the hardware - YubiKey, stateless nonprogrammable discrete logic gate firewall, optical data diode, powerful radio transmitters, direct conversion receivers.

Performance (ie. Integrity and Availability) and interoperability are critical for usability. Thus, data will be transmitted plainly for one-to-many synchronization, and all authentication will use plaintext headers and forward error correction not necessitating any search for decryptable symbols.
