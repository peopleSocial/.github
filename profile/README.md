People just talking to people. Who would invent that?

Instead of a social network, just the code for a common language to speak into the publicly shared internet and radio space around the globe.

Predominantly written in Rust, mixing open-source code for things like email, chat, authentication, fast decentralized internet, bittorrent, (non-profit storage, synchronization, retransmission) blockchain, professionally assisted browsing, digital radio, and amateur radio. 


AGPLv3 for all code not owned by other authors. Independent development will be done if necessary to minimize non-AGPLv3 code. NO relicensing.
