People just talking to people. Who would invent that?

Instead of a social network, just the code for a common language (ie. bittorrent protocol) to speak into the publicly shared internet and radio space around the globe.

The major advantage of such direct one-to-many communication, is the absence of targeted advertising.

The major advantage of an absence of targeted advertising, is the drastically reduced attack surface for both cybersecurity integrity exploits, and for bad management following up.

ie. You don't have a poorly managed account to get locked out of with zero customer service, you have a government issued amateur radio license, and you're innocent until proven guilty in court.

# Design
Predominantly written in Rust, mixing open-source code for things like email, chat, PIV/OpenGPG hardware/YubiKey transaction authentication, official transaction revocation/repudiation, fast decentralized internet, bittorrent video streaming, (non-profit reputation, reviews, storage, synchronization, retransmission) blockchain, professionally assisted browsing, radio positioning, network/radio collision backoff, software disciplined FSK digital radio, and amateur radio. 


All compilable to just one app or any other apps and with support for the hardware - YubiKey, stateless nonprogrammable discrete logic gate firewall, optical data diode, powerful radio transmitters, direct conversion receivers.

Performance (ie. Integrity and Availability) and interoperability are critical for usability. Thus, data will be transmitted plainly for one-to-many synchronization, and all authentication will use plaintext headers and forward error correction not necessitating any search for decryptable symbols.

# License
AGPLv3 for all code not owned by other authors. Independent development will be done if necessary to minimize non-AGPLv3 code. NO relicensing, never, not ever.
