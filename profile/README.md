People just talking to people. Who would invent that?

An interactive network connection has three useful and fun purposes:
1) Broadcasting to share a resource.
2) Uploading a resource on request.
3) Uploading a resource elsewhere.

Realize very carefully downloading is NOT on that list. Yet, the process of uploading has perversely been dominated by downloading, to the point such is the normal method of editing Wikipedia articles, pushing open source code. Exchanging real time chat messages in particular is done this same way, by downloading a website which download rather than uploads a connection to a store and forwarddatabase.

As most content and software is increasingly user generated, it is strange that the sharing and monetization is done by a few corporations which theirselves also MUST decentralize the content. Worse, downloading by uploading involves the open security hole of JavaScript client side code.


Perversely yet entirely predictably, the harms of - spread of malware, misappropriation of intellectual property, declining cultural richness - have been made far worse by the absence of the basic shared database which peer-to-peer file sharing really amounts to.

Internet users are by and large mature enough to create, consume, monetize, and moderate their own resources.

Yet the internet is structured in a way that is neither efficient, usable, secure, nor moderated.


# Background

For commercial purposes, the commercial internet has been resoundingly made good use of amateur open-source contributions, brought good jobs to out of work politicians, contributed to more select favorite charities, drawn consumers eyes to advertisements for the spending economy, created effectively the largest shopping malls in history, and best of given vendors a chance to put a price on security for enterprises - in sum greasing the unproductive gears with money.

Meanwhile, the amateur purposes of amateur radio have been supplanted by centralized internet platforms.

Peer discovery is the fundamental weakness of the internet - not an issue in physical space but discouraged in IPv4 and infeasible in IPv6. Decentralized storage tracking is correspondingly weak - yes BitTorrent exists but how long would it take to go through the peer discovery and connection process to load just one webpage at a time?

Computers have become faster, and the physics of only electrons and photons being of any mechanical significancee remains. 

Peer discovery and communicating who has what, quickly, are the necessary essence of free speech in this universe, always has been.


# New Functionality

Little to none, but efficient for complete workflows. Open-source basically does everything already - but in clunky pieces.


# Documentation
Anyone who begins reading a large static document has their own questions. To begin using the service, no one should have to read a manual.

Instead, users should be shown the value of a new open-source app, by other users, and by fine tuned generative AI actually answering their questions without exhaustive search.

SHOW, DON'T TELL, is ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT for explaining to small merchants, non-profits with fundraisers, and persons with friends, functionality that requires new ways to transfer money (ie. conversion of USD to cryptocurrency), new tools to keep money safe (ie. hardware wallets), new ways to monetize (ie. increasing download bandwidth after cryptocurrency payment), and may also require a different approach with new services (ie. paid assisted browsing) to quickly communicate with friends not yet migrated to newer technology (ie. still using a social network intermediary).

# Security

Of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability, emphasis must be first on integrity (YubiKey authentication), as otherwise users cannot reestablish communication after, currently inevitable, malware incidents. Availability is the next issue, which pre-singularity can only be addressed by simplifying human intervention.

Simplifying human intervention (against malware intrusion and persistence) is best achieved by simplifiying code and maintenance functions as much as possible, and such specialized hardware as stateless nonprogrammable discrete logic gate firewalls.


# Interoperability and Contribution
Mastadon, Fediverse, ActivityPub, seem interesting.

EMail is rather long established, user@PersonalComputer.com .

REAL TIME collaborative text, video, etc, editing WILL BE A HIGH PRIORITY .

DARK MODE WILL BE PREFERRED. Light mode for messaging will NOT be the best supported option, as a matter of health for anyone with rather common sleep disruption issues.

# Design

*) Rust

*) Mixes existing open source code.


*) Fast IPv4/IPv6 blocked port upload by download punching (NOT just NAT).

*) Sharded Forgetful Blockchain Tested Peers List
*) Distribution of Tested Blockchain Peers List through Peers

*) Peer Discovery by Amateur Radio

*) Peer Discovery by Bluetooth, NFC, QR Code

*) Announcement of Tested Peer by WiFi SSID, Acoustic Signaling, Power Supply QRSS

*) Reception of Tested Peer by Stray Rectification


*) Sub-9kHz Band Reception of Tested Peers


(note: peer discovery from website at static domain is explicitly NOT supported mostly due to expected poor performance for due to expected inevitable underfunding and subsequent intermediary monetization abuse...)
(any peer reception of slow means - ie. Sub-9kHz Band - will include 50% specially marked high bandwidth peers and by default will first be used to obtain more complete shards)
(all extraordinary shards will include a blockchain signature corresponding to a shard including at least that shard)


*) Feed with Threads and Replies.

*) EMail.

*) Chat (through file sharing, possibly refined or scrutinized ActivityPub, but strictly peer-to-peer).

*) PIV/OpenPGP hardware/Yubikey transaction authentication (especially usability improvements).

*) Offical transaction/repudiation (ie. officially disowning occasional messages signed by YubiKey prompts enticed by malware).



*) Feed filtering by sriptable fine tuning of Generative AI.


*) EMail/Chat messages entered into FileSharingEquivalentDB asymmetrically encrypt both sender and messages.


*) Chunk/BitTorrent streaming.

*) Live streaming.


(domain name servers for any communication, storage, etc, purpose, EXPLICITLY forbidden)


*) Traditional browser compatibility through Web Clients .


*) Professionally Assisted Browsing


*) Vector and radio positioning addressing for point-to-point radio establishment, finding, messaging.


*) Separate Sharded Blockchain Chunk List

*) Separate Sharded Blockchain Forgetful Storage List


*) Digital Amateur Radio Synchronization of Chunk and Storage Blockchain Shards

*) Network/Radio Collision Backoff

*) Zero-Voltage-Switching Radio Transmitter

*) Direct Conversion Receiver


*) App support for YubiKey, stateless nonprogrammable discrete logic gate firewall, optical data diode, powerful switching radio transmitters (eg. audio modulation NOT needing linear amplification), direct conversion receivers.


Paid support in such a system would take the form of independent software maintenance developers, with any use of generative AI or other non-human support as a fairly competing alternative or a programming code assistant (ie. GitHub copilot), NOT a replacement. Only the users have an incentive to marginalize their own support costs.


All compilable to just one unified app or any other apps.

Video and picture streams will be available from the CLI as reportable, filtered, non-predictable CSPRNG dithered video encoder outputs.

Performance (ie. Integrity and Availability) and interoperability are critical for usability. Thus, it is strongly encouraged when possible (eg. for feed, livestream, etc) to transmit data plainly for one-to-many synchronization of simple messages, and all authentication will use plaintext headers and forward error correction not necessitating any search for decryptable symbols. Thus, while a Web Client may use HTTPS, and HTTPS may be used as a transport protocol, unencrypted data may be transferred.
